• PURPOSE

My app is a history app built for people who love history and those who
just need information about their favourite actor or politician or any
one of influence in history, it is a fun app that is easy to use and you
get know everything you need to know about influential people and the
information pops up on the user's screen in a split second.The digital
world is forcing us to adapt and history needs to be taught in this fast
paced environment of tech and in a way that easy and fast.

Why is user experience so important you may ask.

Over the last decade, 'user experience' (UX) became a buzzword in the
field of human - computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design. As
technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and
usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire. Driven by
the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does
not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use,
practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion
of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term
promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its
definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on
'Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a
provisional answer to the question of what is meant by 'the user
experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX
research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a
forecast of the future, but as a proposal - a stimulus for further UX
research.

<img src="media/image11.png" style="width:2.525in;height:4.475in" />

The impact of colour on the first impression of a website is discussed
in the light of several rather puzzling experimental findings suggesting
that background colour and colour combinations might influence users’
subsequent opinion of, and satisfaction with, a site. Theories of, and
approaches to, studying aesthetics and emotion are outlined briefly. It
is concluded that, although the criteria by which people judge visual
appeal, user satisfaction and trustworthiness are still unclear,
perceived usability appears to be related to the detection of stumbling
blocks that hinder smooth interaction with a web site and probably to
the orderliness of screens. User satisfaction is a complex construct
that incorporates several measurable concepts and is the culmination of
the interactive user experience. Experimental results suggest that
people may be more satisfied with a beautiful product that performs
sub-optimally than with a more usable but less appealing product. A
glance into the future importance of the topics discussed is offered.

See the picture is put at the top and made the first thing the user
sees, it's meant to catch the eye and really get you in the mood to
learn about influential people and their lives.This picture captures a
nostalgic feeling as if you were living in that time as if you were
laughing with them, you see a happy Einstein as if he's welcoming you
into he's world. The UI design is meant to make you smile without even
knowing it

The search function is the most popular design element on content-heavy
websites. Users rely on the search feature to find what they need when
they come across a relatively complex site. Now, the design and
functionality of the search box have become a game-changer!

The search feature is composed of an input field that allows you to
enter text combined with the submit button. As it generally involves
these two basic elements, you might think that search bar design doesn’t
require much thought. Wrong! It is essentially what stands between you
and the information you are looking for.

The search bar(age) as you can see is easy to see,the user we'll see
“enter age”,see that’s how we run our search engine you put in an age
and influential people who died at that age appear on your screen.This
app is new and innovative and also fun, sure you could put in a name but
that seems boring, with this app you put in age a VOILA!!

EASE OF USE

Buttons on websites can help users accomplish tasks more quickly and
efficiently. It is valid for both buttons with text only and those
containing both text and icons. Buttons allow users to choose within a
specific context without leaving the page or searching through a long
list of links or options. The user knows in advance what action will
occur when the button is clicked, so they can make an informed decision
about whether or not they want to act.

VISUAL FEEDBACK

Buttons provide a method for providing the user with immediate visual
feedback. One can use text-only buttons to identify specific actions or
concepts while they remain greyed out or inactive. The user can see what
will occur when the button is clicked rather than guess their meaning
based on what might happen if they click them. Icons on buttons can
reinforce the meaning intended by the text or add another dimension of
meaning to it.

Without the search button the search bar is useless.They go hand in hand

The app's search button is also clear and visible with a colour that
pops,purple and also since most user use their right thumb to type and
balance with their little finger operate their phones it will be easy to
get to the search button as it's at the bottom, the thumb won't be
strained it's not a distance for the user's fingers to cover just easy
as ABC

• Inclusive

Mobile apps can be a great way to reach and engage users, but only if
they are designed with accessibility in mind. Accessibility means making
sure that your app can be used by people with different abilities and
preferences, such as vision, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments.
Involving users with disabilities in the mobile app design process can
help you create a more inclusive, user-friendly, and successful product.
Here are some tips on how to do it.

While the app is far behind for all the other disabilities we have it
covered when it comes to people with problems with their vision.
Although the pictures are colourful,they don't move around the texts are
visible and if it's too bright the user can use the brightness option on
their device.

Inclusive design is a methodology that seeks to create products and
services that can be used by as many people as possible, without
requiring adaptation or special design. Inclusive design principles can
help you design your mobile app with accessibility in mind. This
includes providing various ways of input and output, such as voice,
touch, gesture, or keyboard; ensuring sufficient contrast, size, and
spacing of text, images, and icons; using clear and simple language,
labels, and instructions; avoiding complexity, distractions, and
interruptions; supporting user preferences and customization; and
testing your app with different devices, orientations, and scenarios.

Welcoming language

Using plain, inclusive language welcomes everyone and helps them
understand your app. Carefully review the writing in your app to make
sure that your tone and words don’t exclude people. Here are a few tips
for writing text — also known as copy — that’s direct, easy to
understand, and inclusive.

On our app we don't use any mean language it's straightforward what you
see Is what you get. And by being inclusive and trying to consider
people's feelings we will not try to shy away from the bad things that
these historical figures did during their lifetime no white washing just
straight facts

• User retention

What Is User Retention?

User retention is the name given to the ability of a company or product
to retain its customers over a period of time. It is a critical metric
for businesses as it measures the loyalty of the customer base and the
effectiveness of the company's engagement strategies.

High user retention rates indicate that a product or service is valuable
to its users, encouraging them to continue using it rather than
switching to a competitor.

Why Is User Retention Important?

User retention is important because it helps businesses maintain a
steady customer base, reduce acquisition costs, and increase revenue.
When customers return to a business repeatedly, it shows that they are
satisfied with the product or service and are likely to recommend it to
others.

Retaining customers is also more cost-effective than acquiring new ones,
as it requires less marketing and sales efforts. Specifically, the cost
of acquiring a new user can be as much as five times higher than the
cost of retention.

Additionally, loyal customers tend to spend more and are more willing to
try new offerings from the business. Therefore, focusing on user
retention is crucial for the long-term success and growth of a business.

As the app grows we will begin to add more historical figures which is
meant to grow user numbers and for loyalty we will begin to develop an
algorithm that personalises the experience and users we'll be able to
get updates about historical figures they love, updates about things
such as statues being made in honour of these figures, awards in their
honour and things of that nature

Why so much emphasis on personalise the user's experience?

Personalization is a powerful tool for increasing user retention.
Tailoring the user experience to meet individual preferences and needs
can make users feel valued and understood. This can include personalized
content, recommendations, or user interfaces. By leveraging data
analytics and user feedback, companies can create a more engaging and
relevant experience for each user, encouraging them to return.

• Performance

Mobile app performance is a crucial factor in today's digital landscape,
significantly influencing user experience and the seamless usability of
an application. Speed, usability, and providing a smooth experience
constitute the fundamental elements for success in mobile applications.

Users expect to access the information they need in the fastest and most
efficient way possible. Mobile app performance encompasses various
aspects, including the app's opening time, the fluidity of transitions
between pages, ease of searching for desired keywords, and the swift and
accurate functioning of filters. Delays or glitches can lead users to
negatively evaluate an application.

A fast mobile app performance can not only enhance user engagement but
also prompt users to recommend and continue using the application. Since
users prioritize maximum information and efficiency in minimum time, the
speed and accuracy of an application are crucial in preventing users
from turning to alternative apps. Now, let's delve into these parameters
mentioned above in more detail.

Fast loading plays a vital role in the initial interaction between
mobile applications and users. The application gains instant access to
the user's device, creating a positive first impression. Users do not
waste time on quickly loading applications and can immediately access
the content they desire. Conversely, slow-loading applications test the
user's patience and increase the risk of losing potential customers.
Fast loading is a fundamental factor influencing the user's decision to
use the application, making it a top priority for mobile app developers.
A positive first impression increases user loyalty and generates
positive feedback.

Smooth User Interface: The Significance of Interactions

A smooth user interface (UI) plays a critical role in the user
interactions of mobile applications. The UI shapes every moment of
interaction with the application, determining the overall user
experience. Fast and seamless transitions, smooth animations, and a
user-friendly layout allow users to easily comprehend and use the
application. A smooth user interface draws users into an immersive
experience, thereby increasing the popularity and interaction level of
the application. Users evaluate applications more positively when they
interact with an easily accessible and intuitive interface. Therefore,
developers focusing on UI optimization are crucial for a successful
mobile app experience.

Performance directly influences the user engagement of mobile
applications. Fast loading and a smooth user interface determine the
speed at which users interact with application content. Effective
content and interactions increase the time users spend interacting with
the application, strengthening user loyalty

• Security and privacy

When it comes to designing mobile applications, data privacy and
security should be at the forefront of consideration. With the
implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
businesses must ensure that their mobile apps are compliant with these
strict regulations to protect users' personal information.

.The Impact of GDPR on Mobile App Design

Since its implementation in 2018, GDPR has had a significant impact on
how businesses collect, store, and process personal data. Mobile
applications are no exception, as they often collect and handle
sensitive information such as contact details, location data, and
payment information. Failure to comply with GDPR regulations can result
in hefty fines and damage to a company's reputation.

When designing a mobile app, developers must take into account the
following GDPR principles:

Transparency: Inform users about data collection and processing
practices.

Consent: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting their
data.

Data Minimization: Collect only the data that is necessary for the app's
functionality.

Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data.

Accountability: Be able to demonstrate compliance with GDPR regulations.

Key Considerations for GDPR Compliance

When designing a mobile app that complies with GDPR regulations,
developers should consider the following key aspects:

Privacy by Design: Incorporate data protection measures into the app
from the initial stages of development.

Data Mapping: Understand how data flows through the app and where it is
stored.

Privacy Policy: Clearly outline the app's data handling practices in a
user-friendly privacy policy.

User Rights: Allow users to access, update, and delete their personal
data as per GDPR requirements.

Data Breach Response Plan: Develop a plan to respond to data breaches
and notify users in a timely manner.

Benefits of GDPR Compliance in Mobile App Design

Implementing GDPR principles in mobile app design offers several
benefits for both businesses and users:

Enhanced Data Security: By following strict data protection measures,
businesses can prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to user
information.

Trust and Transparency: Demonstrating compliance with GDPR regulations
builds trust with users and showcases a commitment to data privacy.

Legal Compliance: Avoid costly fines and legal consequences by ensuring
that the app meets GDPR requirements.

Competitive Advantage: Stand out in the market by offering users a
secure and transparent mobile app experience.

In conclusion, implementing GDPR principles in mobile app design is
crucial for ensuring data privacy and security. By following best
practices and considering key aspects such as privacy by design and user
rights, developers can create GDPR-compliant apps that protect user data
and comply with regulations. Failure to adhere to GDPR requirements can
result in severe consequences, so it is essential for businesses to
prioritize data protection in their mobile app design process.

Since our app is still in its starting phase we will not ask for the
user's data but we will insure that our servers are impenetrable to keep
those pesky hackers out and as the app grows we will take necessary
steps that user data is protected and to uphold our integrity data will
not be sold to any third party

• Conclusion to running a successful mobile application

6\. Keep security in mind

trend of mobile app development in 2023.

When developing mobile and web apps we often deal with these security
threats:

Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM): Hackers may place themselves between a
user and a system server. Once it happens, a hacker has access to
sensitive data and is able to compromise it.

Advanced persistent threats (APT): Attackers gain unauthorized access to
system networks or hardware to steal sensitive and private data,
avoiding detection by system security members.

Password attacks: A hacker may get access to the password of a user by
guessing in a random or symmetric way, gaining access to the system
database, or using social engineering.

Social engineering attacks: This kind of attack means manipulating users
in a psychological way and requires them to perform actions that give
hackers access to the users’ confidential information.

The lack of safety precautions in the app poses an identity threat to

development company can keep you away from all this hassle.

confidential & sensitive data from your app!
